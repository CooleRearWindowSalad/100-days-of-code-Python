# 100 days of code - Python Edition

A personal Python learning repository focused on coding challenges, exercises, and reading assignments.

## 📖 About

This repository documents my journey through Python practice, inspired by the 100 Days of Code challenge.

The goal is to learn Python programming by coding in it every day, completing small challenges, and reflecting on what 
I learn.

## 🎯 Goals

- Practicing Python through daily coding challenges
- Building consistency in coding and problem-solving
- Learning Python fundamentals step by step
- Tracking progress over time
