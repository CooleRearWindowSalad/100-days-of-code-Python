# 100 days of code - Python Edition

## 📖 About

This repository is used for my personal journey through the **100 Days of Code** challenge using Python.

The goal of this project is to build consistency in Python programming by coding daily, completing small challenges, 
studying theory, and reflecting on progress over time. It is intended as a learning log and reference, but
others are welcome to explore or learn from it.

## 🎯 Goals

- Practicing Python through daily coding challenges
- Building consistency in coding and problem-solving
- Learning Python fundamentals step by step
- Tracking progress over time
